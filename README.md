# ATM Banking Program

Hey there! Welcome to the **ATM Banking Program** project! This is a simple console-based program built in Java that works like an ATM. You can check your balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and it even makes sure your PIN is secure.

## Features
- **PIN Validation**: Ensures you enter the correct 4-digit PIN with a maximum of 3 tries.  
- **Account Actions**:
  - Check your account balance.
  - Deposit funds.
  - Withdraw cash (but only if it's a valid choice!).  
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Keeps asking until you enter valid inputs, just like a real ATM.

## Future Implementations
This program is still a **Work In Progress**, and here are some cool features planned for the future:
1. **Account Balance Tracking**: Add functionality to display, update, and track the balance dynamically.  
2. **Transaction History**: Introduce a feature to log and display recent transactions.  
3. **Multiple Account Support**: Enable the program to handle multiple users with unique PINs.  
4. **Enhanced Security**: Include features like PIN reset and account lockout after multiple invalid attempts.  
5. **User Interface Improvements**: Make the menu more interactive and visually appealing in the console.  
6. **Withdrawal Limit Validation**: Implement checks for withdrawal limits and sufficient balance.  

Got an idea for something else? Feel free to suggest or experiment with new features! üòÑ
